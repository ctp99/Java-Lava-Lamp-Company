Business Application:
Our business application is an inventory and customer management system for a direct-to-consumer lava lamp store, Lavish Lava Lamps. Our program will help Lavish Lava Lamps view and store information on their lamp inventory, customer orders, customers, and those customers that choose to become members.

To conceptualize the process flow between classes, we developed a business process management diagram and UML Diagram. 

After conceptualizing the flow, we developed classes and methods so people can interact with our program.
